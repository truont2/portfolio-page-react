### General Info

This project utilized HTML, CSS, and React to build a responsive ann stylish portfolio page. There is a about me section, links to the github repositories, skills/resume section, and a contact section. Building from scratch, the webpage was build using react to create the  various pages and components, then used CSS to add style. To accomplish the layout and styling of some elements on the page, Bootstrap was used combined with manual styling through CSS. 

This project taught me the fundementals of React and how to visualize applications as a combination of various components.  React was initially difficult to understand and implement at the beginning due to its format being completely different than my previous projects. Regardless, after working through the project and doing some tutorials on react, I was able to complete this portfolio page.
